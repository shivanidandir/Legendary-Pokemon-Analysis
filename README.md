# Legendary-Pokemon-Analysis
R project


The project is based on investigating the characteristics of legendary Pokémon and further prediction of them. Found that there are 70 legendary Pokémon out of 801 total pokemon – a sizable minority at 9% of the population. And there is no relation of weight and height as there are many outliers present.Also, while more than 30% of flying and psychic Pokémon are legendary, there is no such thing as a legendary poison or fighting Pokémon! According to box-plot the legendary pokemons surpass normal ones in each category but there are a number of outliers in each case, meaning that some legendary Pokémon are anomalously weak. Predicted with the help of decison tree( AUC - 78%) and Random forest(AUC- 91%). Conclusion,  Pokémon are characterized primarily by the power of their special attacks and secondarily by their speediness, while also exhibiting higher fighting abilities across the board.
